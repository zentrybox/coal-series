# Guidelines

Coal Series guidelines provide the guardrails for building cohesive cybersecurity experiences.

## Color system

- **Coal foundation:** `#0B0D10` background, `#11141A` surface alt, and graphite borders anchor high-contrast interfaces.
- **Accent:** Choose a single accent—Electric Blue (`#38A0FF`), Cyber Purple (`#7E4DFF`), or Emerald Green (`#2AD0A8`).
- **Status palette:**
  - Critical `#FF3B4E`
  - Warning `#FF9F2D`
  - Safe `#36D27E`
  - Info `#4DC0FF`
- **Usage:** Keep accent saturation under 30% of the viewport; rely on grayscale layering for depth.

## Typography

Coal Series standardizes IBM Plex for both UI and telemetry.

- Headings use Plex Sans with optical tracking.
- Tabular data and logs use Plex Mono.
- Font sizes follow a `1.125` ratio: display (`56px`), h1 (`36px`), h2 (`28px`), h3 (`22px`), body (`16px`), small (`14px`).

## Spacing & layout

- Base unit `8px` scales to `12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 / 64 / 80`.
- Grids: 12 columns on desktop (`80px` gutters), 8 columns tablet, single column mobile.
- Cards use `24px` vertical padding on desktop, compressing gracefully on smaller breakpoints.

## Motion

- **Scan pulse:** `coal-scan` keyframe loops every 3s.
- **Radar sweep:** `coal-radar` keyframe rotates full circle every 8s.
- **Duration:** Keep UI transitions between `120–240ms`; avoid easing that feels playful.
- Motion must communicate system state changes (scan started, node quarantined) rather than decorative flair.

## Accessibility

- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 across all states.
- Support keyboard focus by default—Coal Series buttons expose focus-visible rings.
- Offer reduced motion preference fallback by disabling looping animations when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.
