# Coal Series

Coal Series is the cybersecurity design language from **zentrybox**, crafted for network device management and vulnerability scanning workflows. It embraces IBM Carbon principles—clarity, hierarchy, and purposeful motion—while amplifying coal-black surfaces, electric accents, and mission-critical telemetry.

      Built for enterprise teams managing global infrastructure, Coal Series balances precision with speed. Each token, component, and pattern furthers situational awareness, letting analysts spot anomalies within seconds.

## Principles

1. **Signal-first.** Visual hierarchy routes attention to risk signals without overwhelming analysts.
2. **Command center clarity.** Every surface feels like an operations console—dense, legible, and calm.
3. **Human + machine collaboration.** Components scale from manual triage to autonomous playbooks.
4. **Accessible by default.** Contrast, focus, and motion are tuned for low-vision and keyboard users.

## Architecture

Coal Series ships as a monorepo with shared tokens, React primitives, and two Next.js experiences:

- `packages/tailwind-preset`: Tailwind theme tokens, utilities, and motion primitives.
- `packages/react-components`: Typed React components, from buttons to the vulnerability radar widget.
- `apps/docs`: This documentation hub built with MDX.
- `apps/showcase`: A live dashboard demonstrating end-to-end usage.

## Roadmap

- Charts: Intrusion timelines and compliance widgets.
- Patterns: Guided threat hunt and remediation pipelines.
- Localization: RTL support and region-aware formatting.
