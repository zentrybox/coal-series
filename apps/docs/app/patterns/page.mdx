# Patterns

Coal Series patterns combine tokens and components into end-to-end workflows tailored to vulnerability management.

## Command center dashboard

1. **Global posture banner:** Stack metric callouts inside a card row to communicate KPIs.
2. **Vulnerability radar:** Pair the circular radar widget with the blast radius heatmap to show impact and spread.
3. **Device inventory table:** Use styled tables with severity chips and row hover states for quick triage.
4. **Activity log:** Render time-stamped events using Plex Mono and subtle borders.

## Scan automation wizard

1. **Tabs** differentiate scheduled vs ad-hoc scans.
2. **Confirmation dialog** summarises scope, credentials, and expected duration before confirmation.
3. **Exposure score card** appears in the success screen, highlighting delta vs benchmark.

## Alert escalation

1. **Toast / Banner (coming soon):** Use status colors to escalate severity.
2. **Dialog** or **Drawer** summarises detection details with call-to-action buttons.
3. **Data table** lists affected assets; allow bulk actions.

## Motion guidelines

- Use `coal-scan` animation to indicate live sweeps.
- Trigger `coal-radar` when the radar widget receives new telemetry.
- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`; switch to static glows when disabled.

## Content strategy

- Labels use plain language: "Quarantine device" instead of "Execute rule".
- Avoid acronyms without tooltips.
- Provide log context via Plex Mono snippets for reproducibility.
